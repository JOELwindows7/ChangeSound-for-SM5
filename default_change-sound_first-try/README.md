#The First Try ChangeSound
This is the 1st change sound theme. the theme fallbacks to midiman's default theme.
The theme only contains sounds overide, theme info, metrics, that's all.
Most sounds found on www.FreeSound.org, however these sounds bellow are found from other site:
- MusicWheel collapse/expand is minecraft chest close/open. Unfortunately I've lost it and instead found on: www.mattersofgrey.com/minecraft-ringtones/
- Sad trombone (ScreenGameplay failed) can be found of freesound, but I got it from: ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LukyMYp2noo, then goes to the link in the description.~~ FAKE! Kyle stole it, Real one is: http://freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/73581
- Common value, Common start, _Screen cancel, are Windows sounds 2nd generation set (98 to XP) before Aero.
end of list

Now, Please don't grin using this theme. Because some part of the sounds assigned funny overloaded, for limited time.
e.g: MusicWheel Change uses short fart sound, Difficulty select uses shotgun cocking (other) sound because inspired from Pump it Up game,
and Music selected sound is bad explosion at a momment.
